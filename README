This is xsh - an XML Editing Shell
----------------------------------
Copyright (c) 2002 Petr Pajas

The aim of this project is to create a flexible and usable
command-line XML (DOM) editing tool in the manner of Unix shell
interpreters and line-oriented text editors like ed which could be
used either interactively or for batch-mode XML processing.

Already supported features:
---------------------------

- work with multiple DOM trees at once
- XPATH navigation
- copy/move nodes within a DOM tree or between two DOM trees
- node deletion
- node creation (element, attribute, text, cdata, comment)
- XPATH search and XML listing of nodes matched with XPATH
- conditional statements
- while statement
- foreach statement allowing usage of relative XPATH expression
- command output filtering with unix pipe, for example
  xsh> list //word | grep [A-Z] | less 
  to read a list all word elements containing chars from [A-Z] in less
- use of system commands (!ls) like in ftp
- extensive help
- and more

Instalation:

list. To install xsh itself, check PREFIX in config.mk and type `make
install'. If you don't trust make-files, read INSTALL for details on
manual installation.
