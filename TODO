TODO:

* get rid of the XSH subdirectory in the CVS tree
* alias 'help commands' for 'help commands'?
* document the installation process for ActiveState perl
* support DTD modification
* better support for namespaces (e.g. registering as soon as it's available
  in XML::LibXML(::XPath?)
* 'locate' - allow use also nearest id() 
* xsh-grammar: parse xslt parameters as XPATH instead of XSH expressions ??
* check the XML::LibXML module for XPath-ruled tree additions
