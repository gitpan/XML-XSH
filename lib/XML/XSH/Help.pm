General notes:

  XSH acts as a command interpreter. Individual commands must be separated
  with a semicolon. Each command may be followed by a pipeline redirection
  to capture the command's output. In the interactive shell, backslash may
  be used at the end of line to indicate that the command follows on the
  next line.

  A pipeline redirections may be used either to feed the command's output
  to a unix command or to store it in a XSH string variable.

  In the first case, the syntax is `xsh-command | shell-command ;' where
  `xsh-command' is any XSH command and `shell-command' is any command (or
  code) recognized by the default shell interpreter of the operating system
  (i.e. on UNIX systems by `sh' or `csh', on Windows systems by `cmd').
  Brackets may be used to join more shell commands (may depend on which
  shell is used).

Example: Count attributes of words containing string foo in its name or
  value.

  xsh> ls //words/@* | grep foo | wc

  In order to store a command's output in a string variable, the pipeline
  redirection must take the form `xsh-command |> $variable' where
  `xsh-command' is any XSH command and `$variable' is any valid name for a
  string <variable>variable.

Example: Store the number of all words in a variable named count.

  xsh> count //words |> $count

  `<help> command' gives a list of all XSH commands.

  `<help> type' gives a list of all argument types.

  `<help>' followed by a command or type name gives more information on the
  particular command or argument type.

$HELP{'expression'}=[<<'END'];
expression argument type

description:
	     Expression is a string consisting of unquoted characters other
	     than whitespace or semicolon, single quote or double quote
	     characters or quoted characters of any kind (but see also
	     special case of expression - so called here-documents -
	     described below). Quoting means either preceding a single
	     character with a backslash or enclosing a part of the string
	     into single quotes '...' or double quotes "...". Quoting
	     characters are removed from the string so they must be quoted
	     themselves if they are a part of the expression: \\, \' or " '
	     ", \" or ' " '. Unquoted (sub)expressons and (sub)expressions
	     quoted with double-quotes are subject to variable, Perl, and
	     XPath expansions.

	     Variable expansion replaces substrings of the form $id or
	     ${id} with the value of the variable named $id, unless the '$'
	     sign is quoted.

	     Perl expansion evaluates every substring enclosed in between
	     `${{{' and `}}}' as a Perl expresson (in very much the same
	     way as the <perl> command) and replaces the whole thing with
	     the resulting value.

	     XPath interpolation evaluates every substring enclosed in
	     between `${{' and `}}' as an XPath expression (in very much
	     the same way as the <count> command) and substitutes the whole
	     thing with the resul.

	     For convenience, another kind XPath interpolation is performed
	     on expressions. It replaces any substring occuring between
	     `${(' and `)}' with a literal result of XPath evaluation of
	     the string. This means, that if the evaluation results in a
	     node-list, the textual content of its first node is
	     substituted rather than the number of nodes in the node-list
	     (as with `${{ ... }}').

Example:
             echo foo "bar"                        # prints: foo bar
             echo foo"bar"                         # prints: foobar
             echo foo'"bar"'                       # prints: foo"bar"
             echo foo"'b\\a\"r'"                   # prints: foo'b\a"r'
             $a="bar"
             echo foo$a                            # prints: foobar
             echo foo\$a                           # prints: foo$a
             echo '$a'                             # prints: '$a'
             echo "'$a'"                           # prints: 'bar'
             echo "${{//middle-earth/creatures}}"  # prints: 10
             echo '${{//middle-earth/creatures}}'  # prints: ${{//middle-earth/creatures}}
             echo ${{//creature[1]/@name}}         # !!! prints: 1
             echo ${(//creature[1]/@name)}         # prints: Bilbo
             echo ${{{ join(",",split(//,$a)) }}}  # prints: b,a,r

	     There is one more special type of expressions, so called
	     ``here-documents'' following syntax of similar constructs in
	     Bash and Perl. Following a `<<' you specify a string to
	     terminate the quoted material, and all lines following the
	     current line down to the terminating string are the value of
	     the expression. The terminating string is either quoted or
	     unquoted identifier (a word). If quoted, the type of quotes
	     you use determines the treatment of the text, just as in
	     regular quoting, i.e. in case of double quotes, the material
	     contained in the here-document is subject to variable, Perl,
	     and XPath expansions. An unquoted identifier works just like
	     double quotes. There must be no space between the `<<' and the
	     identifier. The terminating string must appear by itself
	     (unquoted and with no surrounding whitespace) on the
	     terminating line.

Example:
             $a="bar"
             echo foo <<END baz;
             xx $a yy
             END
             # prints foo xx bar yy baz
             echo foo <<"END" baz;
             xx $a yy
             END
             # same as above
             echo foo <<'END' baz;
             xx $a yy
             END
             # prints foo xx $a yy baz

$HELP{'xpath'}=[<<'END'];
XPath argument type

description:
	     XSH supports arbitrary XPath expression as defined in W3C
	     recommendation at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath. (Nice
	     interactive XPath tutorials and references can be found at
	     http://www.zvon.org.) In XSH, XPath expressoin may be
	     optionally preceded with a document identifier followed by
	     colon (<id>:xpath). If no document identifier is given, the
	     current document is used.

	     As an extension, the following XPath extension functions are
	     defined in the XSH namespace:

	     `xsh:doc(id-string)' - returns a nodelist consisting of the
	     document node associated in XSH with an identifier given in
	     `id-string'.

	     `xsh:matches(match-string,regexp-string)' - returns `true' if
	     `match-string' matches the regular expression given in
	     `regexp-string'. Otherwise returns `false'.

	     `xsh:grep(node-set, regexp-string)' - returns a node set
	     consisting of nodes of the given `node-set' whose content (as
	     returned by the built-in XPath function `string()' matches the
	     regular expression given in `regexp-string'.

	     `xsh:same(node-set1, node-set2)' - returns `true' if the given
	     node sets both contain the same node (in XPath, this can also
	     be expressed as
	     `count(node-set1|node-set2)+count(node-set1)+count(node-set2)=
	     1').

Example:     Open a document and count all sections containing a subsection

             xsh scratch:/> open v = mydocument1.xml;
             xsh v:/> open k = mydocument2.xml;
             xsh k:/> count //section[subsection]; # searches k
             xsh k:/> count v://section[subsection]; # searches v

$HELP{'try'}=[<<'END'];
usage:       try <command-block> catch [[local] $<id>] <command-block>
             
description:
	     Execute <command-block> following the `try' keyword. If an
	     error or exception occures during the evaluation, execute the
	     `catch' <command-block>. If a variable follows `catch' and the
	     `try' block fails, an error message of the exception occured
	     is stored to the variable before the `catch' block is
	     executed. Optionally, the variable name may be preceded with
	     the keyword `local' in order to make the assignment local to
	     the `catch' block (see <local>).

	     The <throw> command and the equivalent perl construction `perl
	     { die "error message" }' allow user to throw custom
	     exceptions.

Example:     Handle parse errors

             try {
               open XML doc=$input;

aliases:     define

description:
	     Define a new XSH subroutine named <id>. The subroutine may
	     require zero or more parameters of nodelist or string type.
	     These are declared as a whitespace-separated list of (so
	     called) parametric variables (of nodelist or string type). The
	     body of the subroutine is specified as a <command-block>.
	     Note, that all subroutine declarations are processed during
	     the parsing and not at run-time, so it does not matter where
	     the subroutine is defined.

	     The routine can be later invoked using the <call> command
	     followed by the routine name and parameters. Nodelist
	     parameters must be given as an XPath expressions, and are
	     evaluated just before the subroutine's body is executed.
	     String parameters must be given as (string) <expression>s.
	     Resulting node-lists/strings are stored into the parametric
	     variables before the body is executed. These variables are
	     local to the subroutine's call tree (see also the <local>
	     command). If there is a global variable using the same name as
	     some parametric variable, the original value of the global
	     variable is replaced with the value of the parametric variable
	     for the time of the subroutine's run-time.

	     Note that subroutine has to be declared before it is called
	     with <call>. If you cannot do so, e.g. if you want to call a
	     subroutine recursively, you have to pre-declare the subroutine
	     using a `def' with no <command-block>. There may be only one
	     full declaration (and possibly one pre-declaration) of a
	     subroutine for one <id> and the declaration and
	     pre-declaration has to define the same number of arguments and
	     their types must match.

Example:
             def l3 %v {
               ls %v 3; # list given nodes upto depth 3
             }
             call l3 //chapter;

Example:     Commenting and un-commenting pieces of document

             def comment
                 %n      # nodes to move to comments

	     In this case, <xpath> is evaluated in a simmilar way as in the

	     occuring in that node-list is used. Use the `string()' XPath
	     function to obtain a literal values in these cases.

Example:     String expressions

description:
	     Use the <expression> to create a new node of a given
	     <node-type> in the <location> relative to the given <xpath>.

	     For element nodes, the format of the <expression> should look
	     like "<element-name att-name='attvalue' ...>". The `<' and `>'
	     characters are optional. If no attributes are used, the
	     expression may simply consist the element name. Note, that in
	     the first case, the quotes are required since the expression
	     contains spaces.

	     Attribute nodes use the following syntax: "att-name='attvalue'
	     [...]".

	     For the other types of nodes (text, cdata, comments) the
	     expression should contain the node's literal content. Again,
	     it is necessary to quote all whitespace and special characters
	     as in any expression argument.

	     The <location> argument should be one of: `after', `before',
	     `into', `replace', `append' or `prepend'. See documentation of
	     the <location> argument type for more detail.

	     The namespace <expression> is only valid for elements and
	     attributes and must evaluate to the namespace URI. In that
	     case, the element or attribute name must have a prefix. The
	     created node is associated with a given namespace.

Location argument type

description:
	     One of: `after', `before', `into', `append', `prepend',
	     `replace'.

	     NOTE: XSH 1.6 introduces two new values for location argument:
	     `append' and `prepend' and slighlty changes behavior of
	     `after' and `before'!

	     This argument is required by all commands that insert nodes to
	     a document in some way to a destination described by an XPath
	     expression. The meaning of the values listed above is supposed
	     be obvious in most cases, however the exact semantics for
	     location argument values depends on types of both the source
	     node and the target node.

	     `after/before' place the node right after/before the
	     destination node, except for when the destination node is a
	     document node or one of the source nodes is an attribute: If
	     the destination node is a document node, the source node is
	     attached to the end/beginning of the document (remember: there
	     is no "after/before a document"). If both the source and
	     destination nodes are attributes, then the source node is
	     simply attached to the element containing the destination node
	     (remember: there is no order on attribute nodes). If the
	     destination node is an attribute but the source node is of a
	     different type, then the textual content of the source node is
	     appended to the value of the destination attribute (i.e. in
	     this case after/before act just as append/prepend).

	     `append/prepend' appends/prepends the source node to the
	     destination node. If the destination node can contain other
	     nodes (i.e. it is an element or a document node) then the
	     entire source node is attached to it. In case of other
	     destination node types, the textual content of the source node
	     is appended/prepended to the content of the destination node.

	     `into' can also be used to place the source node to the end of
	     an element (in the same way as `append'), to attach an
	     attribute to an element, or, if the destination node is a text
	     node, cdata section, processing-instruction, attribute or
	     comment, to replace its textual content with the textual
	     content of the source node.

	     `replace' replaces the entire destination node with the source
	     node except for the case when the destination node is an
	     attribute and the source node is not. In such a case only the
	     value of the destination attribute is replaced with the
	     textual content of the source node. Note also that document
	     node can never be replaced.

description:
	     EXPERIMENTAL! This command is not yet guaranteed to remain in
	     the future releases.

	     DOCUMENTATION OBSOLETE! Syntax changed!

	     This command may be used to sort the node-list stored in the
	     node-list variable <id>. First, for each node in the node-list
	     %<id>, the first argument (either a <xpath> or <perl-code>
	     expression), which serves as a sorting criterion, is evaluated
	     in the context of the node and the obtained value is stored
	     together with the node. (In case of <xpath> the result of
	     whatever type is cast to a string). Then perl's sorting
	     algorithm is used to sort the nodelist, consulting the second,
	     <perl-code>, argument to compare nodes. Before the <perl-code>
	     is evaluated, the values obtained from the previous evaluation
	     of the sorting crierion argument on the two nodes being
	     compared are stored into `$a' and `$b' variables in the
	     respective order. The <perl-code> being consulted is supposed
	     to return either -1 (the first node should come first), 0 (no
	     order precedence), or 1 (the second node should come first).
	     Note that Perl provides very convenient operators `cmp' and
	     `<=>' for string and numeric comparison of this kind as shown
	     in the examples below.

	     Remember that `sort' (unlike <assign>, <if>, or <while>)
	     evaluates the first <xpath> argument (the sorting criterion)
	     in a way to obtain a string. Thus you need not to bother with
	     wrapping node-queries with a `string()' function but you must
	     remember to explicitly wrap the expression in `count()' if the
	     number of the nodes is to be the sorting criterion.

Example:     Sort creatures by name (XPath-based sort) in ascending order
	     using current locale settings

             xsh> local %c=/middle-earth[1]/creatures
             xsh> sort @name { use locale; lc($a) cmp lc($b) } %c
             xsh> xmove %c into /middle-earth[1]# replaces the creatures

Example:     Sort (descending order) a node-list by score (Perl-based sort)

             xsh> sort { $scores{ literal('@name') } } { $b <=> $a } %players

END


$HELP{'map'}=[<<'END'];
usage:       map <perl-code> <xpath>
             
aliases:     sed

description:
	     This command provides an easy way to modify node's data
	     (content) using arbitrary Perl code.

	     Each of the nodes matching <xpath> is passes its data to the
	     <perl-code> via the `$_' variable and receives the (possibly)
	     modified data using the same variable.

	     Since element nodes do not really have any proper content
	     (they are only a storage for other nodes), node's name (tag)
	     is used in case of elements. Note, however, that recent
	     versions of XSH provide a special command <rename> with a very
	     similar syntax to `map', that should be used for renaming
	     element, attribute, and processing instruction nodes.

Example:     Capitalises all hobbit names

             xsh> map { $_=ucfirst($_) } //hobbit/@name

Example:     Changes goblins to orcs in all hobbit tales.

             xsh> map { s/goblin/orc/gi } //hobbit/tale/text()

$HELP{'rename'}=[<<'END'];
usage:       rename <perl-code> <xpath>
             
description:
	     This command is very similar to the <map> command, except that
	     it operates on nodes' names rather than their data/values. For
	     every element, attribute or processing-instruction matched by
	     the <xpath> expression the following procedure is used: 1) the
	     name of the node is stored into Perl's `$_' variable, 2) the
	     <perl-code> is evaluated, and 3) the (posibly changed) content
	     of the `$_' variable is used as a new name for the node.

Example:     Renames all hobbits to halflings

             xsh> map $_='halfling' //hobbit

Example:     Make all elements and attributes uppercase

             xsh> map { $_=uc($_) } (//*|//@*)

description:
	     Save the document identified by <id>. Using one of the `FILE',
	     `PIPE', `STRING' keywords the user may choose to save the
	     document to a file send it to a given command's input via a
	     pipe or simply return its content as a string. If none of the
	     keywords is used, it defaults to FILE. If saving to a PIPE,
	     the <expression> argument must provide the coresponding
	     command and all its parameters. If saving to a FILE, the
	     <expression> argument may provide a filename; if omitted, it
	     defaults to the original filename of the document. If saving
	     to a STRING, the <expression> argument is ignored and may
	     freely be omitted.

	     The output format is controlled using one of the XML, HTML,
	     XInclude keywords (see below). If the format keyword is
	     ommited, save it defaults to XML.

	     Note, that a document should be saved as HTML only if it
	     actually is a HTML document. Note also, that the optional
	     encoding parameter forces character conversion only; it is up
	     to the user to declare the document encoding in the
	     appropriate HTML <META> tag.

	     The XInclude keyword automatically implies XML format and can
	     be used to force XSH to save all already expanded XInclude
	     sections back to their original files while replacing them
	     with <xi:include> tags in the main XML file. Moreover, all
	     material included within <include> elements from the
	     http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude namespace is saved to separate
	     files too according to the `href' attribute, leaving only
	     empty <include> element in the root file. This feature may be
	     used to split the document to new XInclude fragments.

	     The encoding keyword followed by a <enc-string> can be used to
	     convert the document from its original encoding to a different
	     encoding. In case of XML output, the <?xml?> declaration is
	     changed accordingly. The new encoding is also set as the
	     document encoding for the particular document.

$HELP{'iterate'}=[<<'END'];
usage:       iterate <xpath> <command-block>
             
description:
	     Iterate works very much like the XPath variant of <foreach>,
	     except that `iterate' evaluates the <command-block> as soon as
	     a new node matching a given <xpath> is found. As a limitation,
	     the <xpath> expresion used with `iterate' may only consist of
	     one XPath step, i.e. it cannot contain an XPath step separator
	     `/'.

	     What are the benefits of `iterate' over a <foreach> loop,
	     then? Well, under some circumstances it is efficiency, under
	     other there are none. To clarify this, we have to dive a bit
	     deeper into the details of XPath implementation. By
	     definition, the node-list resulting from evaluation of an
	     XPath has to be ordered in the canonical document order. That
	     means that an XPath implementation must contain some kind of a
	     sorting algorithm. This would not itself be much trouble if a
	     relative document order of two nodes of a DOM tree could be
	     determined in a constant time. Unfortunately, the libxml2
	     library, used behind XSH, does not implement mechanisms that
	     would allow this complexity restriction (which is, however,
	     quite natural and reasonable approach if all the consequences
	     are considered). Thus, when comparing two nodes, libxml2
	     traverses the tree to find their nearest common ancestor and
	     at that point determines the relative order of the two
	     subtrees by trying to seek one of them in a list of right
	     siblings of the other. This of course cannot be handled in a
	     constant time. As a result, the sorting algorithm, reasonably
	     efficient for a constant time comparison (polynomial of a
	     degree < 1.5) or small node-lists, becomes rather unusable for
	     huge node-lists with linear time comparison (still polynomial
	     but of a degree > 2).

	     The `iterate' command provides a way to avoid sorting the
	     resulting nodelist by limiting allowed XPath expression to one
	     step (and thus one axis) at a time. On the other hand, since
	     `iterate' is implemented in Perl, a proxy object glueing the C
	     and Perl layers has to be created for every node the iterator
	     passes by. This (plus some extra subroutine calls) makes it
	     about two to three times slower compared to a similar
	     tree-traversing algorithm used by libxml2 itself during XPath
	     evaluation.

	     Our experience shows that `iterate' beats <foreach> in
	     performance on large node-lists (>=1500 nodes, but your milage
	     may vary) while <foreach> wins on smaller node-lists.

	     The following two examples give equivallent results. However,
	     the one using iterate may be faster esp. if the number of
	     nodes being counted is very large.

Example:     Count inhabitants of the kingdom of Rohan in productive age

             cd rohan/inhabitants;
             iterate child::*[@age>=18 and @age<60] { perl $productive++ };
             echo "$productive inhabitants in productive age";

Example:     Using XPath

             $productive=count(rohan/inhabitants/*[@age>=18 and @age<60]);
             echo "$productive inhabitants in productive age";

	     Use e.g. `| time cut' pipe-line redirection to benchmark a XSH
	     command on a UNIX system.

description:
	     EXPERIMENTAL! This command provides a memory efficient (though
	     slower) way to process selected parts of an XML document with
	     XSH. A streaming XML parser (SAX parser) is used to parse the
	     input. The parser has two states which will be refered to as A
	     and B below. The initial state of the parser is A.

	     In the state A, only a limited vertical portion of the DOM
	     tree is built. All XML data comming from the input stream
	     other than start-tags are immediatelly copied to the output
	     stream. If a new start-tag of an element arrives, a new node
	     is created in the tree. All siblings of the newly created node
	     are removed. Thus, in the state A, there is exactly one node
	     on every level of the tree. After a node is added to the tree,
	     all the <xpath> expressions following the `select' keyword are
	     checked. If none matches, the parser remains in state A and
	     copies the start-tag to the output stream. Otherwise, the
	     first expression that matches is remembered and the parser
	     changes its state to B.

	     In state B the parser builds a complete DOM subtree of the
	     element that was last added to the tree before the parser
	     changed its state from A to B. No data are sent to the output
	     at this stage. When the subtree is complete (i.e. the
	     corresponding end-tag for its topmost element is encountered),
	     the <command-block> of instructions following the <xpath>
	     expression that matched is invoked with the root element of
	     the subtree as the current context node. The commands in
	     <command-block> are allowed to transform the whole element
	     subtree or even to replace it with a different DOM subtree or
	     subtrees. They must, however, preserve the element's parent as
	     well as all its ancestor nodes intact. Failing to do so can
	     result in an error or unpredictable results.

	     After the subtree processing <command-block> returns, all
	     subtrees that now appear in the DOM tree in the place of the
	     original subtree are serialized to the output stream. After
	     that, they are deleted and the parser returns to state A.

	     Note that this type of processing highly limits the amount of
	     information the XPath expressions can use. First notable fact
	     is that elements can not be selected by their content. The
	     only information present in the tree at the time of the XPath
	     evaluation is the element's name and attributes plus the same
	     information for all its ancestors. There is nothing known yet
	     about possible child nodes of the element as well as of the

Files/Documents
---------------

  XSH is intended to query and manipulate XML and HTML documents. Use one
  of the `open/open-*/create' commands to load an XML or HTML document from
  a local file, external URL (such as http:// or ftp://), string or pipe.
  While loading, XSH parses and optionally validates (see <validation> and
  <load-ext-dtd>) the document. Parsed documents are stored in memory as
  DOM trees, that can be <navigated>navigated and <manipulated>manipulated
  quite similarly to a local filesystem.

  Every opened document is associated with an identifier (<id>), that is a
  symbolic name for the document in XSH and can be used for example as a
  prefix of <xpath>.

  In the current version, XSH is only able to save documents locally. To
  store a document on any other location, use <ls> command and pipe
  redirection to feed the XML representation of the document to any
  external program that is able to store it on a remote location.

Example: Store XSH document DOC on a remote machine using Secure Shell

  xsh> ls DOC:/ | ssh my.remote.org 'cat > test.xml'

$HELP{'Navigation'}=[<<'END'];
Tree navigation
---------------

  With XSH, it is possible to browse <document trees>document trees as if
  they were a local filesystem, except that <XPath>XPath expressions are
  used instead of ordinary UNIX paths.

  Current position in the document tree is called the current node. Current
  node's XPath may be queried with <pwd> command. In the interactive shell,
  current node is also displayed in the command line prompt. Remember, that
  beside <cd> command, current node (and document) is silently changed by
  all variant of <open> command, <create> command and temporarily also by
  the node-list variant of the <foreach> statement.

  Documents are specified in a similar way as harddrives on DOS/Windows(TM)
  systems (except that their names are not limitted to one letter in XSH),
  i.e. by a prefix of the form doc: where doc is the <id> associated with
  the document.

  To mimic the filesystem navigation as closely as possible, XSH contains
  several commands named by analogy of UNIX filesystem commands, such as
  <cd>, <ls> and <pwd>.

Example:
  xsh scratch:/> open docA="testA.xml"
  xsh docB:/> open docB="testB.xml"
  xsh> pwd
  docB:/
  xsh docB:/> cd docA:/article/chapter[title='Conclusion']
  xsh docA:/article/chapter[5]> pwd
  docA:/article/chapter[5]

Tree modification
-----------------

  XSH provides mechanisms not only to browse and inspect the DOM tree but
  also to modify its content by providing commands for copying, moving, and
  deleting its nodes as well as adding completely new nodes or XML
  fragments to it. It is quite easy to learn these commands since their
  names or aliases mimic their well-known filesystem analogies. On the
  other hand, many of these commands have two versions one of which is
  prefixed with a letter "x". This "x" stands for "cross", thus e.g.
  <xcopy> should be read as "cross copy". Let's explain the difference on
  the example of <xcopy>.

  When you copy, you have to specify what are you copying and where are you
  copying to, so you have to specify the source and the target. XSH is very
  much XPath-based so, XPath is used here to specify both of them. However,
  there might be more than one node that satisfies an XPath expression. So,
  the rule of thumb is that the "cross" variant of a command places one and
  every of the source nodes to the location of one and every destination
  node, while the plain variant works one-by-one, placing the first source
  node to the first destination, the second source node to the second
  destination, and so on (as long as there are both source nodes and
  destinations left).

Example:
  xsh> create a "<X><A/><Y/><A/></X>";
  xsh> create b "<X><B/><C/><B/><C/><B/></X>";
  xsh> xcopy a://A replace b://B;
  xsh> copy b://C before a://A;
  xsh> ls a:/;
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <X><C/><A/><Y/><C/><A/></X>
  
  xsh> ls b:/;
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <X><A/><A/><C/><A/><A/><C/><A/><A/></X>

  As already indicated by the example, another issue of tree modification
  is the way in which the destination node determines the target location.
  Should the source node be placed before, after, or into the resulting
  node? Should it replace it completely? This information has to be given
  in the <location> argument that usually precedes the destination XPath.

  Now, what happens if source and destination nodes are of incompatible
  types? XSH tries to avoid this by implicitly converting between node
  types when necessary. For example, if a text, comment, and attribute node
  is copied into, before or after an attribute node, the original value of
  the attribute is replaced, prepended or appended respectively with the
  textual content of the source node. Note however, that element nodes are
  never converted into text, attribute or any other textual node. There are
  many combinations here, so try yourself and see the results.

  You may even use some more sofisticated way to convert between node
  types, as shown in the following example, where an element is first
  commented out and than again uncommented. Note, that the particular
  approach used for resurrecting the commented XML material works only for
  well-balanced chunks of XML.

Example: Using string variables to convert between different types of nodes

  create doc <<EOF;
  <?xml version='1.0'?>

    <chapter>
      <title>Intro</title>

Flow control
------------

  What a scripting language XSH would be had it not some kind of
  conditional statements, loops and other stuff that influences the way in
  which XSH commands are processed.

  Most notable XSH's feature in this area is that some of the basic flow
  control statements, namely <if>, <unless>, <while> and <foreach> have two
  variants, an XPath-based one and a Perl-based one. The XPath-based
  variant uses <xpath> expressions to specify the condition or node-lists
  to iterate, while the other one utilizes <perl-code> for this purpose.
  See descriptions of the individual statements for more detail.

Retrieving more information
---------------------------

  Beside the possibility to browse the DOM tree and list some parts of it
  (as described in <Navigation>), XSH provides commands to obtain other
  information related to open documents as well as the XSH interpreter
  itself. These commands are listed bellow.


Related commands:

Argument Types
--------------

  XSH commands accept different types of arguments, such as usual strings
  (<expression>) or <XPath expressions>XPath expressions. Notably, these
  two types and types based on them support string variable interpolation.
  See documentation of the individual types for more information.

$HELP{'Variables'}=[<<'END'];
Variables
---------

  In the current version, XSH supports two types of variables: string
  (scalar) variables and node-list variables. Perl programmers that might
  miss some other kinds of variables (arrays or hashes) may use the support
  for <interacting with Perl>interacting with Perl to access these types
  (see some examples below).

  These two kinds of variables differ syntactically in the prefix: string
  variables are prefixed with a dollar sign (`$') while node-list variables
  are prefixed with a percent sign (`%').

  String Variables
  ----------------

    Every string variable name consists of a dollar sign (`$') prefix and
    an <id>, that has to be unique among other scalar variables, e.g.
    `$variable'. Values are assigned to variables either by simple
    <assignments>assignments of the form `$variable = <xpath>' or by
    capturing the output of some command with a variable redirection of the
    form `command |> $variable'.

    String variables may be used in <string expressions>string expressions,
    <XPath expressions>XPath expressions, or even in perl-code as $<id> or
    ${<id>}. In the first two cases, variables act as macros in the sense
    that all variables occurences are replaced by the corresponding values
    before the expression itself is evaluated.

    To display current value of a variable, use the <print> command,
    <variables> command or simply the variable name:

Example:
    xsh> $b="chapter";
    xsh> $file="${b}s.xml";
    xsh> open f=$file;
    xsh> ls //$b[count(descendant::para)>10]
    xsh> print $b
    chapter
    xsh> $b
    $b='chapter';
    xsh> variables
    $a='chapters.xml';
    $b='chapter';

  Node-list Variables
  -------------------

    Every string variable name consists of a percent sign (`%') prefix and
    an <id>, that has to be unique among other node-list variables, e.g.
    `%variable'.

    Node-list variables can be used to store lists of nodes that result
    from evaluating an XPath. This is especially useful when several
    changes are performed on some set of nodes and evaluating the XPath
    expression repeatedly would take too long. Other important use is to
    remember a node that would otherwise be extremely hard or even
    impossible to locate by XPath expressions after some changes to the
    tree structure are made, since such an XPath cannot be predicted in
    advance.

    Although node-list variables act just like XPath expressions that would
    result in the same node-list, for implementation reasons it is not
    possible to use node-list variables as parts of complex XPath
    expressions except for one case. They may be only used at the very
    beginning of an XPath expression. So while constructions such as
    `%creatures[4]', `%creatures[@race='elf']', or
    `%creatures/parents/father' do work as expected,
    `string(%creatures[2]/@name)' `//creature[%creatures[2]/@name=@name]',
    or `%creatures[@race='elf'][2]' do not. In the first two cases it is
    because node-list variables cannot be evaluated in the middle of an
    XPath expression. The third case fails because this construction
    actually translates into a sequence of evaluations of
    `self::*[@race='elf'][2]' for each node in the `%creatures' node-list,
    which is not equivallent to the intended expression as the `[2]' filter
    does not apply to the whole result of `%creatures[@race='elf']' at once
    but rather to the partial results.

    Fortunatelly, it is usually possible to work around these unsupported
    constructions quite easily. This is typically done by introducing some
    more variables as well as using the <foreach> statement. The following
    example should provide some idea on how to do this:

Example:
    # work around for $name=string(%creatures[2]/@name)
    xsh> foreach %creatures[2] $name=string(@name)
    # work around for ls //creature[%creatures[2]/@name=@name]
    xsh> ls //creature[$name=@name]
    # work around for ls %creatures[@race='elf'][2]
    xsh> %elves = %creatures[@race='elf']
    xsh> ls %elves[2]

    Remember, that when a node is deleted from a tree it is at the same
    time removed from all node-lists it occurs in. Note also, that unlike
    string variables, node-list variables can not be (and are not intended
    to be) directly accessed from Perl code.

  Accessing Perl Variables
  ------------------------

    All XSH string variables are usual Perl scalar variables from the
    `XML::XSH::Map' namespace, which is the default namespace for any Perl
    code evaluated from XSH. Thus it is possible to arbitrarily intermix
    XSH and Perl assignments:

Example:
    xsh> ls //chapter[1]/title
    <title>Introduction</title>
    xsh> $a=string(//chapter[1]/title)
    xsh> eval { $b="CHAPTER 1: ".uc($a); }
    xsh> print $b
    CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

    If needed, it is, however, possible to use any other type of Perl
    variables by means of evaluating a corresponding perl code. The
    following example demonstrates using Perl hashes to collect and print
    some simple racial statistics about the population of Middle-Earth:

Example:
    foreach a:/middle-earth/creature { 
      $race=string(@race);
      eval { $races{$race}++ };
    }
    print "Middle-Earth Population (race/number of creatures)"
    eval { 
      echo map "$_/$races{$_}\n",
        sort ($a cmp $b), keys(%races); 
    };

Options
-------

  The following commands are used to modify the default behaviour of the
  XML parser or XSH itself. Some of the commands are switch between two
  different modes according to a given expression (which is expected to
  result either in zero or non-zero value). Other commands also working as
  a flip-flop have their own explicit counterpart (e.g. <verbose> and
  <quiet> or <debug> and <nodebug>). This misconsistency is due to
  historical reasons.

  The <encoding> and <query-encoding> options allow to specify character
  encoding that should be expected from user as well as the encoding to be
  used by XSH on output. This is particularly useful when you work with
  UTF-8 encoded documents on a console which supports only 8-bit
  characters.

  The <options> command displays current settings by means of XSH commands.
  Thus it can not only be used to review current values, but also to store
  them future use, e.g. in ~/.xshrc file.

Example:
  xsh> options | cat > ~/.xshrc

$HELP{'Perl_shell'}=[<<'END'];
Interacting with Perl and Shell
-------------------------------

  To allow more complex tasks to be achieved, XSH provides ways for
  interaction with the Perl programming language and the system shell.

  Calling Perl
  ------------

    Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files,
    extracting information from those text files, and printing reports
    based on that information. It's also a good language for many system
    management tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to
    use, efficient, and complete). XSH itself is written in Perl, so it is
    extremely easy to support this language as an extension to XSH.

    Perl <expressions or blocks of code>expressions or blocks of code can
    either be simply evaluated with the <perl> command, used to do quick
    changes to nodes of the DOM tree (see <map> command), used to provide
    list of strings to iterate over in a <foreach> loop, or to specify more
    complex conditions for <if>, <unless>, and <while> statements.

    To prevent conflict between XSH internals and the evaluated perl code,
    XSH runs such code in the context of a special namespace
    `XML::XSH::Map'. As described in the section <Variables>, XSH string
    variables may be accessed and possibly assigned from Perl code in the
    most obvious way, since they actually are Perl variables defined in the
    `XML::XSH::Map' namespace.

    The interaction between XSH and Perl actually works also the other way
    round, so that you may call back XSH from the evaluated Perl code. For
    this, Perl function `xsh' is defined in the `XML::XSH::Map' namespace.
    All parameters passed to this function are interpreted as XSH commands.
    To simplify evaluation of XPath expressions, another three functions:
    The first one, named `count', returns the same value as would be
    printed by <count> command in XSH on the same XPath expression. The
    second function, named `literal', returns the result of XPath
    evaluation as if the whole expression was wrapped with the XPath
    `string()' function. In other words, `literal('doc:expression')'
    returns the same value as `count('doc:string(expression)')'. The third
    function, named `xml_list', returns the result of the XPath search as a
    XML string which is equivallent to the output of a <ls> on the same
    XPath expression (without indentation and without folding or any other
    limitation on the depth of the listing).

    In the following examples we use Perl to populate the Middle-Earth with
    Hobbits whose names are read from a text file called `hobbits.txt',
    unless there are some Hobbits in Middle-Earth already.

Example: Use Perl to read text files

    unless (//creature[@race='hobbit']) {
      perl 'open $file, "hobbits.txt"';
      perl '@hobbits=<$file>';
      perl 'close $file';
      foreach { @hobbits } {
        insert element "<creature name='$__' race='hobbit'>"
          into m:/middle-earth/creatures;
      }
    }

Example: The same code as a single Perl block

    perl {
      unless (count(//creature[@race='hobbit'])) {
        open my $file, "hobbits.txt";
        foreach (<$file>) {
          xsh(qq{insert element "<creature name='$_' race='hobbit'>"
            into m:/middle-earth/creatures});
        }
        close $file;
      }
    };

  Writing your own XPath extension functions in Perl
  --------------------------------------------------

    XSH allows the user to extend the set of XPath functions by providing
    an extension function written in Perl. This can be achieved using the
    <register-function> command. The perl code implementing an extension
    function works as a usual perl routine accepting its arguments in `@_'
    and returning the result. The following conventions are used:

    The arguments passed to the perl implementation by the XPath engine are
    either simple scalars or `XML::LibXML::NodeList' objects, depending on
    the types of the XPath arguments. The implementation is responsible for
    checking the argument number and types. The implementation may use
    arbitrary `XML::LibXML' methods to process the arguments and return the
    result. (`XML::LibXML' perl module documentation can be found for
    example at
    http://search.cpan.org/author/PHISH/XML-LibXML-1.54/LibXML.pm).

    The implementation SHOULD NOT, however, MODIFY the document. Doing so
    could not only confuse the XPath engine but result in an critical error
    (such as segmentation fault).

    Calling XSH commands from extension function implementations is not
    currently allowed.

    The perl code must return a single value, which can be of one of the
    following types: a simple scalar (a number or string),
    `XML::LibXML::Boolean' object reference (result is a boolean value),
    `XML::LibXML::Literal' object reference (result is a string),
    `XML::LibXML::Number' object reference (resulat is a float),
    `XML::LibXML::Node' (or derived) object reference (result is a nodeset
    consisting of a single node), or `XML::LibXML::NodeList' (result is a
    nodeset). For convenience, simple (non-blessed) array references
    consisting of `XML::LibXML::Node' objects can also be used for a
    nodeset result instead of a `XML::LibXML::NodeList'.

  Calling the System Shell
  ------------------------

    In the interactive mode, XSH interprets all lines starting with a
    exclamation mark (`!') as shell commands and invokes the system shell
    to interpret them (this is to mimic FTP command-line interpreters).

Example:

    To invoke a system shell command or program from the non-interactive
    mode or from a complex XSH construction, use the <exec> command.

    Since UNIX shell commands are very powerful tool for processing textual
    data, XSH supports direct redirection of XSH commands output to system
    shell command. This is very similarly to the redirection known from
    UNIX shells, except that here, of course, the first command in the
    pipe-line colone is an XSH command. Since semicolon (`;') is used in
    XSH to separate commands, it has to be prefixed with a backslash if it
    should be used for other purposes.

Example: Use grep and less to display context of `funny'

    xsh> ls //chapter[5]/para | grep funny | less

Example: The same on Windows 2000/XP systems

    xsh> ls //chapter[5]/para | find "funny" | more
