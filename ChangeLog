	* xsh.pl:
	greatly improved grammar (xpath expressions and perl blocks do not
	need quotes, shell-like quoting, semicolon may be used to separate
	commands and may be part of the last token), added new commands
	(include, eval, exec), renamed some commands (for -> map), embedded
	perl code has its own namespace (XSH::Map).

2002-01-18  Petr Pajas  <pajas@ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz>

	* xsh.pl:
	Count changed to support any type of <xpath> expressions, thus
	allowing evaluation of arithmetic, boolean and string expressions in
	addition to the expressions resulting in a node-list. This change also
	affects the if and while statements, providing them with the same power.

	* INSTALL, LICENCE, README, xsh.pl: INSTALL, LICENCE, README added
	xsh.pl - added copyright and GPL notes
